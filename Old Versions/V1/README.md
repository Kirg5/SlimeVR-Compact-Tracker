# Revision 1
First revision of the trackers. I do not reccomened making these as there are several flaws such as random shut downs when the battery is near fully charged and the tracker isnt moving due to total system current usage being below 50ma (PMIC goes into idle state after 10 seconds), and an MPU6050 + HMC5883L imu setup being used which has been proven to be rather unreliable.
